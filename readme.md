# Milestone Project 1 - Knit Knack

### Purpose of this site:
A general, easy to use resource tool for people who want to learn to knit or already might be a knitter, but want some extra patterns or techniques to learn. 

### Developer Goals:
* To make a clean, clear, easy to navigate site that is responsive on multiple screen sizes.

* A professional first pass at making a functional, responsive website using HTML, CSS and the addition of Bootstrap framework.

* To direct users to adequate resources beyond the scope of the basic tutorial video page to further their understanding and abilities in knitting.

* To give some first line inspiration in the patterns section to people looking to learn to knit, or perhaps attempt a more difficult project.


### User Stories:

* I want the user to be able to easily navigate their way through the site, by using a clean and clear navigation bar that sticks to the top of the page for easy finding.
Also through the use of page jump buttons provided, so that they can jump to beginner/intermediate/advanced depending on their preference. 

* To be able to view external links such as the suggested patterns and tutorial videos off site in a new tab.

* The ability to be easily contactable for queries and collaboration requests through the form on the contact page.

* To be able to easily search the site (Hence the search bar being in the header) to find what you need. 


### Design Choices: 

* For most of the pages, I chose to use Bootstrap as it was what I had most recently learned and is a very useful, responsive framework with a lot of built in components that are easily manipulated through CSS. 
However, for the Tutorials page, I chose to slightly challenge myself and not use Bootstrap for it, as I would like to not rely on it as a crutch.

* Fonts: I chose "Raleway" for all of the main headings and then "Roboto Condensed" for the rest of the page text. This was a stylistic choice mostly just because they stood out to me when browsing fonts and I liked how they looked together.

* Colours: I wanted a fairly neutral colour as the primary background (I changed this a few times, going lighter and darker between beige tones until I found one I liked) and a more popping colour without too much in-your-face saturation. 
Purple is the colour I find myself knitting with the most, so that sealed it for me once I found a tone that looked presentable against the beige. 
I used the colour picker in Adobe Photoshop to compare colours until I found ones that matched to my tastes.
The font colour in the heading being white as opposed to the dark grey or beige used on other pages was due to the background being used in the header. 
It blended in far too much with either of those colours and the white didn't look out of place as it matches the Search bar and the card containers on the patterns and contact form pages.

* Styling: I chose rounded corners on the card boxes because it just looks more professional and clean, like you've done something with it rather than just throwing some images on a page and calling it done. 
The white background on the Patterns Card boxes was a stylistic choice based on the fact that many stock photos given by official pattern brands will often have white borders. It just looks generally tidier if you're unsure if you are allowed to alter a stock photo. 

* Images used: I chose stock images from Unsplash (credited in their own section below) and overall chose from the same keywords such as "Knitting", "Knitwear", as it kept the imagery overall consistent.
